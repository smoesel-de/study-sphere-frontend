## Development

Install all dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Launch the frontend:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Visual Studio Code

If you use Visual Studio Code you should install all recommended extensions in `.vscode/extensions.json`.

In `launch.json` is a launch configuration named `pnpm & chrome`. This starts the development server and opens the side in Google Chrome for debugging.
